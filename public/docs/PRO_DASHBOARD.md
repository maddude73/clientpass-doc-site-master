# Pro Dashboard

The Pro Dashboard is the main hub for professional users (stylists, barbers) to manage their business on ClientPass. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing referrals, schedule, earnings, and more.

## Key Features

The Pro Dashboard is organized into several tabs, each focusing on a specific aspect of the user's workflow:

- **Home**: A summary of the day's activity, including earnings and pending referrals. It also provides quick access to key actions like sending a referral or posting an open chair.
- **Timers**: A real-time view of active referral timers, allowing the user to accept or decline incoming referrals.
- **Coverage**: Tools for managing "Coverage Mode", which allows other stylists to cover the user's clients when they are unavailable.
- **Hot Seat**: A feature for posting last-minute appointment openings to fill empty slots.
- **Schedule**: A calendar view of all upcoming and past appointments.
- **Earnings**: A detailed breakdown of earnings from referrals and services.
- **Deposits**: A view of all deposits received from clients.
- **Notifications**: An inbox for all notifications, including new referrals, payment confirmations, and system alerts.
- **Pro Hub**: A place to discover exclusive deals and resources for professionals.
- **Settings**: A comprehensive settings page for managing profile, services, commissions, and more.
