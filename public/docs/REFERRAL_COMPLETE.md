# Referral Complete Component

This document provides a detailed description of the `ReferralComplete` component.

## 1. Overview

The `ReferralComplete` component is a reusable UI element designed to provide a positive and informative confirmation screen after a referral process has been successfully completed (e.g., a referral has been accepted and a booking confirmed). It aims to reinforce the positive outcome and guide the user on next steps.

## 2. Features

### 2.1. Dynamic Confirmation Message

-   Displays a clear and congratulatory message indicating the successful completion of the referral.
-   The message is personalized with the client's name and the stylist's name.

### 2.2. Earnings Summary

-   Provides a summary of the potential earnings or commission generated from the completed referral.
-   This reinforces the value of the referral system for the user.

### 2.3. Next Steps Guidance

-   Offers clear guidance on what the user can expect next (e.g., "Stylist will contact client soon").
-   Provides a button to navigate back to the dashboard, allowing the user to continue with other tasks.

## 3. Usage

The `ReferralComplete` component is used in pages like `WaitingForResponse.tsx` to display a success screen after a referral has been accepted.

```tsx
import { ReferralComplete } from '@/components/success/ReferralComplete';

const MyPage = () => {
  const handleBack = () => {
    console.log('Navigating back to dashboard');
    // Navigate to dashboard
  };

  return (
    <ReferralComplete
      clientName="Jane Doe"
      stylistName="John Smith"
      earningsAmount={75.00}
      onBack={handleBack}
    />
  );
};
```
